"""A pytest plugin as a simplified way to use the ModelFactory.

General usage requires the user to define either a `mf_engine` or a `mf_session` fixture.
Once defined, they can have their tests depend on the exposed `mf` fixture, which should
give them access to any factory functions on which they've called `register_at`.
